        our advertising partners, and in some cases through the use of cookies
        or other similar technologies (which you may consent to, depending on

        websites with our advertising partners to buyers who made purchases with
        other Shopify merchants and who may also be interested in what we have
        to offer. We also share information about your use of the Site, your
        purchases, and the email address associated with your purchases with
        Shopify Audiences, through which other Shopify merchants may make offers
        you may be interested in. For more information about how targeted

        If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to
        processing based solely on automated decision-making (which includes
        profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect on you or
        otherwise significantly affects you. We DO NOT engage in fully automated
        decision-making that has a legal or otherwise significant effect using
        customer data. Our processor Shopify uses limited automated
        decision-making to prevent fraud that does not have a legal or otherwise
        significant effect on you. Services that include elements of automated
        decision-making include: Temporary blacklist of IP addresses associated
        with repeated failed transactions. This blacklist persists for a small
        number of hours. Temporary blacklist of credit cards associated with
        blacklisted IP addresses. This blacklist persists for a small number of
        days.
